# Cosmic-Transparency

This project revolves around coding models for luminosity distances in cosmology which are variable with matter density, cosmological constant density, cosmic opacity and Hubble's constant. These are statistically compared to Union-2.1 SNe and H(z) data (\chi^2 and multi-dimensional likelihoods are drawn) and marginalised over model parameters. As a result, we constrain cosmic opacity at low to intermediate redshifts.

All models we write are tested for error convergence. Throughout the project, we compare intermediate results to well established papers in the field. As a part of that, we reproduce the N. Suzuki et al. 2012 plot of constarins in cosmic parameters from SNe data.

The codes throughout the project have been kept. Completed codes that produce our end results are collected in a separate file named 'Complete Project'.

This work formed part of Bachelors Physics Project for creators: Maciej Tomasz Jarema and Addam Smith. Thus, project reports are also avaliable.
